# Behind The Person

**This Website was created to fullfil the Technical Assignment during applying to HYF Class34**

Through my study in the UK, I got to meet a lot of people from different countries.
One day, over dinner, we were talking about our childhood and it struck me that we had a lot in common; such as Anime shows and street games.
That's why I choose to introduce myself differently by display a punch of Anime's & TV's show that I believe they helped to shape me as a person!
